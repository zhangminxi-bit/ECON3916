# 📊 Economic Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my digital portfolio for **ECON 3916: Statistical & Machine Learning for Economics**.  
This repository showcases my work at the intersection of **economic theory, causal inference, and modern data science**.

## 👤 About Me

I am an undergraduate economics student seeking opportunities in **Data Analysis / Economic Consulting / Finance**.  
My academic focus is on using data-driven methods to answer real economic questions, combining the rigor of traditional econometrics with the scalability of machine learning.

This portfolio reflects my ongoing effort to bridge theory and practice — moving from models on paper to insights derived from data.

## 📁 About This Portfolio

This repository contains coursework, labs, and applied projects completed as part of ECON 3916.

The course follows a **Concept Extension** philosophy:
- We begin with **foundational statistical concepts** (e.g., linear regression, hypothesis testing).
- We then **extend these ideas** using modern machine learning tools (e.g., Lasso, cross-validation, regularization).
- Emphasis is placed on understanding both **causal inference** and **predictive performance**, and knowing when each is appropriate.

Through these exercises, I am developing the ability to:
- Frame economic questions clearly  
- Implement empirical methods correctly  
- Interpret results with economic intuition
